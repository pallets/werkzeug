Werkzeug
========

*werkzeug* German noun: "tool".
Etymology: *werk* ("work"), *zeug* ("stuff")

Werkzeug is a comprehensive `WSGI`_ web application library. It began as
a simple collection of various utilities for WSGI applications and has
become one of the most advanced WSGI utility libraries.

Werkzeug doesn't enforce any dependencies. It is up to the developer to
choose a template engine, database adapter, and even how to handle
requests.
