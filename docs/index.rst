Werkzeug
========

*werkzeug* German noun: "tool".
Etymology: *werk* ("work"), *zeug* ("stuff")

Werkzeug is a comprehensive `WSGI`_ web application library. It began as
a simple collection of various utilities for WSGI applications and has
become one of the most advanced WSGI utility libraries.

Werkzeug is Unicode aware and doesn't enforce any dependencies. It is up
to the developer to choose a template engine, database adapter, and even
how to handle requests.
