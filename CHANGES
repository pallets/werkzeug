Werkzeug Changelog
==================

Version 0.5
-----------
(codename yet to be selected, release date unknown)

- fixed a bug in :class:`~contrib.IterIO`
- added :class:`MIMEAccept` and :class:`CharsetAccept` that work like the
  regular :class:`Accept` but have extra special normlization for mimetypes
  and charsets and extra convenience methods.
- switched the serving system from wsgiref to something homebaked.
- the :class:`Client` now supports cookies.
- added the :mod:`~werkzeug.contrib.fixers` module with various
  fixes for webserver bugs and hosting setup side-effects.
- added :mod:`werkzeug.contrib.wrappers`
- added :func:`is_hop_by_hop_header`
- added :func:`is_entity_header`
- added :func:`remove_hop_by_hop_headers`
- added :func:`pop_path_info`
- added :func:`peek_path_info`
- added :func:`wrap_file` and :class:`FileWrapper`
- moved `LimitedStream` from the contrib package into the regular
  Werkzeug one and changes the default behavior to raise exceptions
  rather than stopping without warning.  The old class will stick in
  the module until 0.6.
- implemented experimental multipart parser that replaces the old CGI
  hack.  If you are experiencing problems with the development version
  of 0.5 regarding form data and file uploads, please report a critical
  bug and let us know!!!
- added :func:`dump_options_header` and :func:`parse_options_header`
- added :func:`quote_header_value` and :func:`unquote_header_value`
- :func:`url_encode` and :func:`url_decode` now accept a separator
  argument to switch between `&` and `;` as pair separator.  The magic
  switch is no longer in place.
- all form data parsing functions as well as the :class:`BaseRequest`
  object have parameters (or attributes) to limit the number of
  incoming bytes (either totally or per field).
- added :class:`LanguageAccept`

Version 0.4.1
-------------
(Bugfix release, released on January 11th 2009)

- `werkzeug.contrib.cache.Memcached` accepts now objects that
  implementt the memcache.Client interface as alternative to a list of
  strings with server addresses.
  There is also now a `GAEMemcachedCache` that connects to the Google
  appengine cache.
- explicitly convert secret keys to bytestrings now because Python
  2.6 no longer does that.
- `url_encode` and all interfaces that call it, support ordering of
  options now which however is disabled by default.
- the development server no longer resolves the addresses of clients.
- Fixed a typo in `werkzeug.test` that broke `File`.
- `Map.bind_to_environ` uses the `Host` header now if available.
- Fixed `BaseCache.get_dict` (#345)
- `werkzeug.test.Client` can now run the application buffered in which
  case the application is properly closed automatically.
- Fixed `Headers.set` (#354).  Caused header duplication before.
- Fixed `Headers.pop` (#349).  default parameter was not properly
  handled.
- Fixed UnboundLocalError in `create_environ` (#351)
- `Headers` is more compatible with wsgiref now.
- `Template.render` accepts multidicts now.
- dropped support for Python 2.3

Version 0.4
-----------
(codename Schraubenzieher, released on November 23rd 2008)

- `Client` supports an empty `data` argument now.
- fixed a bug in `Response.application` that made it impossible to use it
  as method decorator.
- the session system should work on appengine now
- the secure cookie works properly in load balanced environments with
  different cpu architectures now.
- `CacheControl.no_cache` and `CacheControl.private` behavior changed to
  reflect the possibilities of the HTTP RFC.  Setting these attributes to
  `None` or `True` now sets the value to "the empty value".
  More details in the documentation.
- fixed `werkzeug.contrib.atom.AtomFeed.__call__`. (#338)
- `BaseResponse.make_conditional` now always returns `self`.  Previously
  it didn't for post requests and such.
- fixed a bug in boolean attribute handling of `html` and `xhtml`.
- added graceful error handling to the debugger pastebin feature.
- added a more list like interface to `Headers` (slicing and indexing
  works now)
- fixed a bug with the `__setitem__` method of `Headers` that didn't
  properly remove all keys on replacing.
- added `remove_entity_headers` which removes all entity headers from
  a list of headers (or a `Headers` object)
- the responses now automatically call `remove_entity_headers` if the
  status code is 304.
- fixed a bug with `Href` query parameter handling.  Previously the last
  item of a call to `Href` was not handled properly if it was a dict.
- headers now support a `pop` operation to better work with environ
  properties.


Version 0.3.1
-------------
(released on June 24th 2008)

- fixed a security problem with `werkzeug.contrib.SecureCookie`.
  More details available in the `release announcement`_.

- added `_get_current_object` method to `LocalProxy` objects

  `HTTPUnicodeError` which (if not cought) behaves like a `BadRequest`.
- adde `BadRequest.wrap`.
- added ETag-support to the SharedDataMiddleware and added an option
  to disable caching.

- fixed `Accept.values`.

  to the function.
- added `validate_arguments`
- added `BaseRequest.application`
- improved Python 2.3 support
- `run_simple` accepts `use_debugger` and `use_evalex` parameters now,
  like the `make_runserver` factory function from the script module.

- it's now possible to initialize requests as "shallow" requests which
  causes runtime errors if the request object tries to consume the
  input stream.

  301 status code instead of 302.

  now too.
- `werkzeug.script` has a different caller format for boolean arguments now.

- the wsgiref subclass werkzeug uses for the dev server does not use direct
  sys.stderr logging any more but a logger called "werkzeug".
- implemented `Href`.
- implemented `find_modules`
- refactored request and response objects into base objects, mixins and
  full featured subclasses that implement all mixins.
