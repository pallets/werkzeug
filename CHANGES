Werkzeug Changelog
==================

Version 0.6
-----------
(last pre 1.0 release. will get rid of deprecation warnings. release date yet unknown)

- removed pending deprecations
- sys.path is now printed from the testapp.
- fixed an RFC 2068 incompatibility with cookie value quoting.
- the :class:`FileStorage` how gives access to the multipart headers.
- `cached_property.writeable` was deprecated.
- :meth:`MapAdapter.match` now accepts a `return_rule` keyword argument
  that returns the matched `Rule` instead of just the `endpoint`
- :meth:`routing.Map.bind_to_environ` raises a more correct error message
  now if the map was bound to an invalid WSGI environment.
- added support for SSL to the builtin development server.
- Response objects are no longer modified in place when they are evaluated
  as WSGI applications.  For backwards compatibility the `fix_headers`
  function is still called until in Werkzeug 0.6 if it was overridden.
  You should however change your application to use `get_wsgi_headers` if
  you need header modifications before responses are sent.
- :func:`append_slash_redirect` no longer requires the QUERY_STRING to be
  in the WSGI environment.
- added :class:`~werkzeug.contrib.wrappers.DynamicCharsetResponseMixin`
- added :class:`~werkzeug.contrib.wrappers.DynamicCharsetRequestMixin`
- added :attr:`BaseRequest.url_charset`
- request and response objects have a default `__repr__` now.
- builtin data structures are pickleable now.
- the form data parser decides on the file to use based on the filename
  now not on the content type.  This fixes a bug with Google Chrome.
- improved performance of `make_line_iter` and the multipart parser
  for binary uploads.
- fixed :attr:`~werkzeug.BaseResponse.is_streamed`
- fixed a path quoting bug in `EnvironBuilder` that caused PATH_INFO and
  SCRIPT_NAME to end up in the environ unquoted.
- :meth:`werkzeug.BaseResponse.freeze` now sets the content length.
- for unknown HTTP methods the request stream is now always limited
  instead of being empty.  This makes it easier to implement DAV
  and other protocols on top of Werkzeug.
- added :meth:`werkzeug.MIMEAccept.best_match`
- multi-value test-client posts from a standard dictionary are now
  supported.  Previously you had to use a multi dict.
- rule templates properly work with submounts, subdomains and
  other rule factories now.

Version 0.5.1
-------------
(bugfix release for 0.5, released on July 9th 2009)

- fixed boolean check of :class:`FileStorage`
- url routing system properly supports unicode URL rules now.
- file upload streams no longer have to provide a truncate()
  method.
- implemented :meth:`BaseRequest._form_parsing_failed`.
- fixed #394 
- :meth:`ImmutableDict.copy`, :meth:`ImmutableMultiDict.copy` and
  :meth:`ImmutableTypeConversionDict.copy` return mutable shallow
  copies.
- fixed a bug with the `make_runserver` script action.
- :meth:`MultiDict.items` and :meth:`MutiDict.iteritems` now accept an
  argument to return a pair for each value of each key.
- the multipart parser works better with hand-crafted multipart
  requests now that have extra newlines added.  This fixes a bug
  with setuptools uploades not handled properly (#390)
- fixed some minor bugs in the atom feed generator.
- fixed a bug with client cookie header parsing being case sensitive.
- fixed a not-working deprecation warning.
- fixed package loading for :class:`SharedDataMiddleware`.
- fixed a bug in the secure cookie that made server-side expiration
  on servers with a local time that was not set to UTC impossible.
- fixed console of the interactive debugger.


Version 0.5
-----------
(codename Schlagbohrer, released on April 24th 2009)

- requires Python 2.4 now
- fixed a bug in :class:`~contrib.IterIO`
- added :class:`MIMEAccept` and :class:`CharsetAccept` that work like the
  regular :class:`Accept` but have extra special normalization for mimetypes
  and charsets and extra convenience methods.
- switched the serving system from wsgiref to something homebrew.
- the :class:`Client` now supports cookies.
- added the :mod:`~werkzeug.contrib.fixers` module with various
  fixes for webserver bugs and hosting setup side-effects.
- added :mod:`werkzeug.contrib.wrappers`
- added :func:`is_hop_by_hop_header`
- added :func:`is_entity_header`
- added :func:`remove_hop_by_hop_headers`
- added :func:`pop_path_info`
- added :func:`peek_path_info`
- added :func:`wrap_file` and :class:`FileWrapper`
- moved `LimitedStream` from the contrib package into the regular
  werkzeug one and changed the default behavior to raise exceptions
  rather than stopping without warning.  The old class will stick in
  the module until 0.6.
- implemented experimental multipart parser that replaces the old CGI hack.
- added :func:`dump_options_header` and :func:`parse_options_header`
- added :func:`quote_header_value` and :func:`unquote_header_value`
- :func:`url_encode` and :func:`url_decode` now accept a separator
  argument to switch between `&` and `;` as pair separator.  The magic
  switch is no longer in place.
- all form data parsing functions as well as the :class:`BaseRequest`
  object have parameters (or attributes) to limit the number of
  incoming bytes (either totally or per field).
- added :class:`LanguageAccept`
- request objects are now enforced to be read only for all collections.
- added many new collection classes, refactored collections in general.
- test support was refactored, semi-undocumented `werkzeug.test.File`
  was replaced by :class:`werkzeug.FileStorage`.
- :class:`EnvironBuilder` was added and unifies the previous distinct
  :func:`create_environ`, :class:`Client` and
  :meth:`BaseRequest.from_values`.  They all work the same now which
  is less confusing.
- officially documented imports from the internal modules as undefined
  behavior.  These modules were never exposed as public interfaces.
- removed `FileStorage.__len__` which previously made the object
  falsy for browsers not sending the content length which all browsers
  do.
- :class:`SharedDataMiddleware` uses `wrap_file` now and has a
  configurable cache timeout.
- added :class:`CommonRequestDescriptorsMixin`
- added :attr:`CommonResponseDescriptorsMixin.mimetype_params`
- added :mod:`werkzeug.contrib.lint`
- added `passthrough_errors` to `run_simple`.
- added `secure_filename`
- added :func:`make_line_iter` 
- :class:`MultiDict` copies now instead of revealing internal
  lists to the caller for `getlist` and iteration functions that
  return lists.
- added :attr:`follow_redirect` to the :func:`open` of :class:`Client`.
- added support for `extra_files` in
  :func:`~werkzeug.script.make_runserver`

Version 0.4.1
-------------
(Bugfix release, released on January 11th 2009)

- `werkzeug.contrib.cache.Memcached` accepts now objects that
  implement the memcache.Client interface as alternative to a list of
  strings with server addresses.
  There is also now a `GAEMemcachedCache` that connects to the Google
  appengine cache.
- explicitly convert secret keys to bytestrings now because Python
  2.6 no longer does that.
- `url_encode` and all interfaces that call it, support ordering of
  options now which however is disabled by default.
- the development server no longer resolves the addresses of clients.
- Fixed a typo in `werkzeug.test` that broke `File`.
- `Map.bind_to_environ` uses the `Host` header now if available.
- Fixed `BaseCache.get_dict` (#345)
- `werkzeug.test.Client` can now run the application buffered in which
  case the application is properly closed automatically.
- Fixed `Headers.set` (#354).  Caused header duplication before.
- Fixed `Headers.pop` (#349).  default parameter was not properly
  handled.
- Fixed UnboundLocalError in `create_environ` (#351)
- `Headers` is more compatible with wsgiref now.
- `Template.render` accepts multidicts now.
- dropped support for Python 2.3

Version 0.4
-----------
(codename Schraubenzieher, released on November 23rd 2008)

- `Client` supports an empty `data` argument now.
- fixed a bug in `Response.application` that made it impossible to use it
  as method decorator.
- the session system should work on appengine now
- the secure cookie works properly in load balanced environments with
  different cpu architectures now.
- `CacheControl.no_cache` and `CacheControl.private` behavior changed to
  reflect the possibilities of the HTTP RFC.  Setting these attributes to
  `None` or `True` now sets the value to "the empty value".
  More details in the documentation.
- fixed `werkzeug.contrib.atom.AtomFeed.__call__`. (#338)
- `BaseResponse.make_conditional` now always returns `self`.  Previously
  it didn't for post requests and such.
- fixed a bug in boolean attribute handling of `html` and `xhtml`.
- added graceful error handling to the debugger pastebin feature.
- added a more list like interface to `Headers` (slicing and indexing
  works now)
- fixed a bug with the `__setitem__` method of `Headers` that didn't
  properly remove all keys on replacing.
- added `remove_entity_headers` which removes all entity headers from
  a list of headers (or a `Headers` object)
- the responses now automatically call `remove_entity_headers` if the
  status code is 304.
- fixed a bug with `Href` query parameter handling.  Previously the last
  item of a call to `Href` was not handled properly if it was a dict.
- headers now support a `pop` operation to better work with environ
  properties.


Version 0.3.1
-------------
(released on June 24th 2008)

- fixed a security problem with `werkzeug.contrib.SecureCookie`.

- `MultiDict`, `CombinedMultiDict`, `Headers`, and `EnvironHeaders` raise
  special key errors now that are subclasses of `BadRequest` so if you
  don't catch them they give meaningful HTTP responses.
- added support for alternative encoding error handling and the new
  `HTTPUnicodeError` which (if not caught) behaves like a `BadRequest`.
- added `BadRequest.wrap`.
- added ETag support to the SharedDataMiddleware and added an option
  to disable caching.

- fixed error handling of the url adapter's `dispatch` method. (#318)
- fixed bug with `SharedDataMiddleware`.
- fixed `Accept.values`.

  to the function.
- added `validate_arguments`
- added `BaseRequest.application`
- improved Python 2.3 support
- `run_simple` accepts `use_debugger` and `use_evalex` parameters now,
  like the `make_runserver` factory function from the script module.

- it's now possible to initialize requests as "shallow" requests which
  causes runtime errors if the request object tries to consume the
  input stream.

- Added `werkzeug.contrib.securecookie`
- Exceptions have a ``get_response()`` method that return a response object

  sys.stderr logging any more but a logger called "werkzeug".
- implemented `Href`.
- implemented `find_modules`
- refactored request and response objects into base objects, mixins and
  full featured subclasses that implement all mixins.
